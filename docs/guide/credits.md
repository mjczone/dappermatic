## Created By

DapperMatic is developed and maintained by **[MJCZone Inc.](https://www.mjczone.com)**, a software development company focused on building high-quality developer tools and enterprise solutions.

### Our Mission

At MJCZone, we believe in creating tools that make developers' lives easier. DapperMatic was born from our own need for a simple, reliable way to manage database schemas programmatically without the overhead of a full ORM.

### Our Experience

MJCZone was incorporated in 2013 as a software consultancy. Our core team members have been programming for over 25 years individually, going back to the late 1990s, spanning the full stack - from enterprise backends to modern web frontends, native mobile applications for Android and iOS, and everything in between. We've worked extensively with most commercial databases and have deep experience in enterprise application architecture.

This broad consulting background means we've encountered the real-world challenges that DapperMatic solves - from startups needing rapid prototyping to enterprises requiring robust schema management across multiple database platforms.
