## 🚧 Current Project Status

**This library is currently in active development and early versions (0.x.x).** While we appreciate community interest, please be aware that:

- **Breaking changes are expected** as we refine the API and architecture
- **Major refactoring efforts** are ongoing to improve code quality and consistency
- **Core functionality** is still being solidified across database providers
- **Public API** may change significantly between releases

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Library version** you're using
2. **Database provider** and version (SQL Server 2022, PostgreSQL 15, etc.)
3. **Minimal reproduction code** that demonstrates the issue
4. **Expected vs actual behavior**
5. **Error messages** or stack traces if applicable
6. **Operating system** and .NET version

## 💭 Suggesting Features

For feature requests, please provide:

1. **Clear description** of the proposed feature
2. **Use case** - why is this feature needed?
3. **Example usage** - how would developers use it?
4. **Database compatibility** - should it work across all providers?

## 🔮 Future Contribution Opportunities

As the library matures and reaches **version 1.0**, we plan to welcome:

- Additional database provider implementations
- Performance optimizations and benchmarks
- Extended test coverage for edge cases
- Advanced features and specialized use cases
- Community-driven examples and tutorials

## 📝 Code Contributions (Limited)

If you'd like to contribute code during this early phase:

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the change
2. **Keep changes small and focused** - large PRs may be difficult to review
3. **Follow existing code patterns** and StyleCop rules
4. **Include tests** for any new functionality
5. **Update documentation** if needed

**Note:** We may not be able to accept all code contributions during this phase due to ongoing architectural changes.
